# Islandle
### What if we made Worldle but with islands?
Today on "Komali is bored" I made this monstrosity  

## How and Why
I <s>am bad at</s> don't like React so I loaded [Babelle](https://babelle.terrylaire.fr) into my browser, copied the entire HTML into a file, copied over the stylesheet, then went from there. As a result, all of animations and inner workings had to be hand made, which was quite fun. Images were created by taking a screenshot of Google Earth, then using GIMP to manually remove the water. Each island usually took me between 5 and 40 minutes

As for the why, why not? 

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit PRs that improve the inner workings of the game. However I would prefer all island additions are run through me before submitting a request. Join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/QWCcXMe) if you have any questions!
